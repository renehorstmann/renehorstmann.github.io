<h2>11 &ndash; Additional information for Californian users</h2>

<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) permits California residents to request from a business, with whom
    the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information about the types of personal
    information the business has collected, shared with, and/or sold to third parties for a business or commercial
    purpose during the immediately preceding calendar year.</p>

<p>As a Californian consumer, you also have the right, at any time, to opt out of any type of selling of your personal
    information.</p>

<p>Please note that (other than in the two situations described immediately below) we do not sell your personal
    information to provide the game or game services described in this Privacy Policy. Our partners and providers who
    work with us may have access to your personal information in order to provide you with the game services within the
    limits and throughout the duration of our agreement, but they can&rsquo;t reuse your personal information for any
    other purposes. Our contracts are strictly drafted to protect your personal information and your privacy rights.</p>

<p><u>Exceptions</u></p>

<p>2) As part of specific partnerships, we may sell your data to a limited number of third-party partners.</p>

    through <a href="mailto:info@horsimann.de">info@horsimann.de</a>.</p>

<p>As we do not sell the personal information of users who are less than 16 years old, only users who are 16 years old
    or older may opt out.</p>

<p>A person legally authorized to act on behalf of a user has the right to opt out for that user. We only provide this
    right to users who are 16 years of age or older, and we may ask them for a copy of an identifying document.</p>

<p>If you submit a request on behalf of another person, we may require a proof of authorization and verification of
    identity directly from them.</p>

<p>In some instances, we may not be able to honor your request. For example, we will not honor your request if we cannot
    verify your identity or if we cannot verify that you have the authority to make a request on behalf of another
    person. Additionally, we will not honor your request when an exception applies, such as when the disclosure of
    Personal Information would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of another consumer or when the Personal
    Information that we maintain about you is not subject to the CCPA&rsquo;s access or deletion rights.</p>

<p>The exercise of any of the rights mentioned above will not have any discriminatory consequences for you.</p>

<p>To exercise your rights, please refer to the &ldquo;How to contact us&rdquo;
    section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
